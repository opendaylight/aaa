I think it is better to have this specified in the key/value pairs above so we can enable multiple realms at a time (i.e., have another MDSALRealm like I have proposed in another patch and possibly create CSV of available realms). For example, one may want to fall back on a local user store if mdsal is down (which still seems to happen quite often).",
