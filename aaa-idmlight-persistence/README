This project is a placeholder for the idmlight version of persistence provided in the aaa project currently.
When the migration of data model and persistence layer logic to the new aaa-persistence is complete, this project could be potentially deleted.
The objective of this project is to separate out the persistence logic from any other logic such as REST from the current aaa-idmlight project to ensure smooth migration.
