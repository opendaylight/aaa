Also as per https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/72169/2/aaa-password-service/impl/pom.xml@46 I expect maven-bundle-plugin anyway exports this package, because its named .impl or .internal.  Having said all that... it\u0027s not a reason to -1 - just don\u0027t think think this is useful or needed, but doesn\u0027t really do any harm, so - anyway.",
