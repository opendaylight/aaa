/**
 * A singleton container of default authorization rules that are installed
 * as part of Shiro initialization.  This class defines an immutable set of
 * rules that are needed to provide system-wide security.  These include
 * protecting certain MD-SAL leaf nodes that contain AAA data from random
 * access.  This is not a place to define your custom rule set;  additional
 * RBAC rules are configured through the shiro initialization file:
 * <code>$KARAF_HOME/shiro.ini</code>
 *
 * An important distinction to consider is that Shiro URL rules work to protect
 * the system at the Web layer, and <code>AuthzDomDataBroker</code> works to
 * protect the system down further at the DOM layer.
