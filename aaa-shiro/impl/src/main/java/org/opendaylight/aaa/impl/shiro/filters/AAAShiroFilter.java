 * The default AAA JAX-RS 1.X Web Filter.  Unlike AAAFilter, which is aimed towards
 * supporting RESTCONF and its existing API mechanisms, AAAShiroFilter is a generic
 * <code>ShiroFilter</code> for use with any other ODL Servlets.  The main difference
 * is that <code>AAAFilter</code> was designed to support the existing noauth
 * mechanism, while this filter cannot be disabled.

 * This class is also responsible for delivering debug information; to enable these
