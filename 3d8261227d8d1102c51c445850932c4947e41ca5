BP should fail but it doesn\u0027t run b/c the BP xml file is under org.opendaylight.blueprint instead of org/opendaylight/blueprint.\n\nWith that corrected, the pom parent change isn\u0027t needed although I\u0027m not sure why changing to bundle-parent somehow masked this issue (I didn\u0027t dig into that).\n\nI pushed a new patch set with this fix.",
