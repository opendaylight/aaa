      "message": "it actually already has some but not everything we need (no JMX), and I was going to suggest to you that this module for tests and standalone should be able to use a more recent Jetty version than the one we have in Karaf, but upon looking more into this, I realized what a fucking mess all this is (and it felt like a \"déjà vue\" of a very similiar situation I hit when I worked on metrics and wanted to use a more recent version of something else).  Basically whatever odlparent has in its dependencyManagement is hard to override - because even if you do here, then if another project where you depend on this (say neutron/integration/test-standalone I\u0027m working on) you hit a confusing nightmare, because Maven will give preference to odlparent\u0027s version of some but not all Jetty JARs... long story short, I\u0027ve ditched and much simplied this in Patch Set 3 - a smaller dependency with no version; that\u0027s clearly the right thing to do here, for now.",
