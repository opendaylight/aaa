Make CassandraClient an interface to make easier replacing Astyanax by a different client.

Make CassandraContext an interface and have an AstyanaxContext.

The CassandraClient could be instantiated by the context to set the consistency level, and thus the context
wouldn't be needed to be passed to the cassandra client.

Add a ColumnFamily class. The com.netflix.astyanax.model.ColumnFamily would be used internally by 
the CassandraClient implementation.

CassandraContext would contain the CassandraClient and a ColumnDecoderProvider that provides column 
decoders based on the type. ColumnDecoder is highly tied to Astyanax, because it reads from Astyanax 
and produces a Column. This could be solved by using DataType<D> instead of the decoder and then have 
the CassadnraClient implementation to internally get the right decoder based on the type. However, 
CustomColumns (with composite values) would not be possible because they need their own decoder.
Try implementing a generic AstyanaxSerializerAdapter that receives a com.hp.common.Serializer as the adaptee.
