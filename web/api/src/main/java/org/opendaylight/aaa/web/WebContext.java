/**
 * Web Context with URL prefix. AKA Web App or Servlet context.
 *
 * <p>
 * Its {@link WebContextBuilder} allows programmatic web component registration
 * (as opposed to declarative e.g. via web.xml, OSGi HTTP Whiteboard blueprint
 * integration, CXF BP etc.)
 *
 * <p>
 * This is preferable because:
 * <ul>
 * <li>using code instead of hiding class names in XML enables tools such as
 * e.g. BND (in the maven-bundle-plugin) to correctly figure dependencies e.g.
 * for OSGi Import-Package headers;
 *
 * <li>explicit passing of web components instances, instead of providing class
 * names in XML files and letting a web container create the new instances using
 * the default constructor, solves a pesky dependency injection (DI) related
 * problem which typically leads to weird hoops in code through
 * <code>static</code> etc. that can be avoided using this;
 *
 * <li>tests can more easily programmatically instantiate web components.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This, not surprisingly, looks somewhat like a Servlet (3.x)
 * {@link ServletContext}, which also allows programmatic dynamic registration
 * e.g. via {@link ServletRegistration}; however in practice direct use of that
 * API has been found to be problematic under OSGi, because it is intended for
 * JSE and <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/1395">does
 * not easily appear to permit dynamic registration at any time</a> (only during
 * Servlet container initialization time by
 * {@link ServletContainerInitializer}), and is generally less clear to use than
 * this simple API which intentionally maps directly to what one would have
 * declared in a web.xml file. This API is also slightly more focused and drops
 * a number of concepts that API has which we do not want to support here
 * (including e.g. security, roles, multipart etc.)
 *
 * <p>
 * It also looks somewhat similar to the OSGi HttpService, but we want to avoid
 * any org.osgi dependency (both API and impl) here, and that API is also less
 * clear (and uses an ancient (!) {@link java.util.Dictionary} in its method
 * signature), and -most importantly- simply does not support Filters and Listeners, only
 * Servlets. The Pax Web API does extend the base OSGi API and adds supports for
 * Filters, Listeners and context parameters, but is still OSGi specific,
 * whereas this offers a much simpler standalone API without OSGi dependency.
 * (The Pax Web API also has confusing signatures in its registerFilter() methods,
 * where one can easily confuse which String[] is the urlPatterns;
 * which we had initially done accidentally; and left AAA broken.)
 *
 * <p>
 * This is immutable, with a Builder, because contrary to a declarative approach
 * in a file such as web.xml, the registration order very much matters (e.g. an
 * context parameter added after a Servlet registration would not be seen by that
 * Servlet; or a Filter added to protect a Servlet might not yet be active
 * for an instant if the registerServlet is before the registerFilter).
 * Therefore, this API enforces atomicity and lets clients first register
 * everything on the Builder, and only then use
 * {@link WebServer#registerWebContext(WebContext)}.
