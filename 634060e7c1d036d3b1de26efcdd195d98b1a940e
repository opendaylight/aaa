      "message": "why you remove the mdsal urls ?  I believe we should keep the initial restricted urls (all aaa restricted urls) in shiro.ini. The access for aaa urls should be only under admin role.   Also add this patch urls so it will be only accessible  by admin.  I\u0027m okay if you have another thoughts, just thinking about the initial state of ODL should be secure.",

      "message": "Done.  So I moved this stuff back in as you suggested for now... I am working on a patch to initialize policies via configuration file.  I really can\u0027t believe that others haven\u0027t had this use case before... really seems like something \"generic\" applications would want.  As far as I can tell, it would also be useful for things like NETCONF (i.e., automatically self mount through network-topology model).  Probably belongs in MD-SAL, but I am not in the mood to fight getting it in there.  The plan is to push a AAA-specific mechanism for initializing AAA data for now.  Maybe we can revisit data initialization from a generic standpoint in Nitrogen.",
