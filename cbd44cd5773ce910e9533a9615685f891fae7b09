I\u0027m not fully familiar with the exact history, and very reluctant to already remove this in this first change here (and have to retest it, and have Ryan retest restconf...).  I therefore propose to get this in as-is already, and perhaps in the future look at if this could be further cleaned-up later.\n\n\u003e  It is up to you as contributor and for committers whether or not you take it into account.\n\nRyan, as the AAA commmiter on this, could you weigh in and clarify if you require this to be further explored in this change, or if you are OK if this goes in like this already?",

One could change this to take a WebInitializer parameter, but this seemed clearer and simpler.\n\nthis is also somewhat related to the other comment in impl-blueprint.xml ... this HAS to be a \u003cbean\u003e in the bundle which is registering web components, and cannot be a \u003cbean\u003e or exposed OSGi service in the web/impl-osgi.  \n\nI guess hypothetically it COULD be a simple class in impl-osgi, and not registered as a Bean nor Service, and then used in the BP XML of a bundle such as aaa-shiro, but that seems more confusing than adding any value, to me.  Think of these few lines here more as simple \"wiring\" that could also have been \"coded in XML\" in impl-blueprint.xml - I\u0027m just an XML hater, and will now raise a follow-up patch where I\u0027ll convert that impl-blueprint.xml to annotation based blueprint instead, where this class will become a @Singleton instead.",
